Bank Management System (JDBC Project)
This is a simple console-based Bank Management System built using Core Java and JDBC.  
The project demonstrates basic banking operations like registration, login, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history.

This project helped me understand how Java interacts with a database and how to structure a real-world application using layers.
